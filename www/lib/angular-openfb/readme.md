## Why it's awesome

Angular wrapper for the OpenFB library allows you to use OpenFB "the Angular way":

- As an Angular service instead of a global object
- Using promises instead of callbacks

About OpenFB:

- OpenFB is a micro-library that lets you integrate your JavaScript application with Facebook.
- OpenFB works for both BROWSER-BASED apps and CORDOVA apps.
- This library has no dependency: You don't need (and shouldn't use) the Facebook SDK with this library.
- Whe running in Cordova, you also don't need the Facebook Cordova plugin.
- There is also no dependency on jQuery.
- OpenFB allows you to login to Facebook and execute any Facebook Graph API request.
